% Function for running the FDMA simulation multiple times more easily. Input the
% total simulation time, number of sources, average rate of packet arrivals
% (lambda), and average service rate (mu). Lambda should be in the form of a
% vector thats length matches the number of soures, and mu should a double.
% Outputs the average age over the duration of the simulation and its standard
% deviation

function [avgAge, stdDevAge] = FDMA(tFinal, numSources, lambda, mu)
