% Function for running the FDMA simulation script multiple times more easily.
% Input the total simulation time, number of sources, average rate of packet
% arrivals (lambda), and average service time (mu). Outputs the average age over
% the duration of the simulation

function avgAge = FDMA(tFinal, numSources, lambda, mu, )
