% Function for running the TDMA simulation multiple times more easily. Input the
% total simulation time, number of sources, slot duration, average rate of
% packet arrivals (lambda), and average service rate (mu). Outputs the average
% age over the duration of the simulation and its standard deviation

function [avgAge, stdDevAge] = TDMA(tFinal, numSources, slotDuration, lambda, mu)
